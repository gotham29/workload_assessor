# Workload Assessor

This repository contains the code module for real-time Mental Workload (MWL) detection from pilot control behavior using behavioral entropy. The code implements the proposed HTM-WL metric along with other established measures such as Fessonia, DNDEB, and a Na√Øve Forecaster. It also includes a real-time MWL spike-detector and evaluation criteria for detection lag and precision.

## Repository Structure

- **source/pipeline/run_pipeline.py**: Main script to execute the data processing pipeline.
- **configs/run_pipeline.yaml**: Configuration file for the pipeline.
- **src/**: Additional modules and helper functions.
